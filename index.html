          <h3>What this is</h3>
          <p>
            The Catholic Experiment is not a programme, a parish or a movement.
            It’s one person’s honest attempt to live the Catholic way of life
           – prayer, sacraments, study, charity – and to
            share what actually happens.
          </p>
          <p>
            No perfect answers. No spiritual heroics. Just a clear-eyed
            journey with the Church, for those who feel a bit lost but still
            want God.

            It has been a while since I have said a prayer and meant it. That's the Gods honest truth. This week I begin by saying ONE Our Father each day, one Hail Mary and One Glory be - may they know I silently pray always, I just do not have the words right now.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn’t about scrupulosity. It’s about learning to see my
            real life – work, mess, parish drama, doom scrolling - everything - –
            in the light of Christ.
