            Anger isn't apostasy. The Psalms are full of it. You can come back

          <h3>1. Just sit in a church</h3>
          <p>
            You don't have to go to Mass yet. Just find a quiet Catholic church 
            during the week, slip in the back, and sit for ten minutes. Don't 
            pray if you can't. Just be there. Let the building hold you. There is no pressure to feel anything. If you can, talk to God silently. If you can't, just breathe. It's as simple as that. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice what you feel. Notice what you don't feel. That's enough 
            for day one. Perhaps on day two, try five more minutes. Day two does not have to be the next day. It can be next week, next month, next year. Go at your own pace. Rome was not built in a day.

          <h3>2. Say one honest thing to God</h3>
          <p>
            Not a formal prayer. Just one true sentence. "I don't know if I 
            believe anymore." "I'm scared." "I miss you." "I'm still angry." 
            "Help." If you know a formal prayer, that's fine too. But don't feel 
            obligated. Ask God to help you understand why you are where you are. Ask for courage to take the next step. Ask for healing for your wounds. Just say one honest thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            God can work with honesty. He can't work with performance. Say 
            the true thing, even if it's ugly. If it's ugly, all the better. God 
            loves ugly honesty.

          <h3>3. Go to one Mass as an observer</h3>
          <p>
            Sit in the back. Don't feel obligated to participate. Don't receive 
            Communion if you're not ready. Just watch. Listen. Remember what 
            it feels like to be in that space.
          </p>
          <p>
            You're allowed to go without committing to anything. You're allowed 
            to feel nothing and still come back next week. You don't even need to stand and kneel if you don't want to. Just be there.

        <article class="tce-card">
          <h3>4. Find one safe person to talk to</h3>
          <p>
            A priest, a spiritual director, a friend who won't judge. You can even talk to people online. Tell them 
            you're trying to come back and you're scared. Tell them what hurt 
            you. Tell them what you need. A problem shared is a problem halved.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the first person isn't safe, find another. Not every priest or 
            Catholic is right for every situation. Keep looking until you find 
            someone who listens.

        <h3>You don't have to go immediately</h3>
        <p>
          If you're not ready, you're not ready. God is patient. Go to Mass, 
          pray, sit with things for a while. Confession will still be there 
          when you're ready.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-top: 1.2rem;">But when you are ready...</h3>
        <p>
          Find a church with scheduled confession times. Some parishes offer 
          "returning Catholics" sessions specifically for people who've been 
          away. You can also call ahead and ask for an appointment.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's okay to tell the priest you're nervous. It's okay to say "I 
          haven't been to confession in [years]." They've heard it before. 
          Most priests are genuinely relieved and joyful when someone comes 
          back.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't have to recount every single thing from decades away. 
          A simple, honest confession of the major patterns and a genuine 
          desire to start again is enough. God knows your heart.

          <h3>LGBTQ Catholics</h3>
          <p>
            This is tender territory. The Church's teaching on sexuality is 
            difficult for many LGBTQ Catholics. You may feel unwelcome, 
            unsafe, or like you have to choose between your identity and 
            your faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't resolve that tension for you. What I can say is that 
            you are made in the image of God, you are loved beyond measure, 
            and your presence in the Church matters. There are same sex attracted Catholics who stay, who wrestle, who pray, and who keep turning back to Christ.
            I am one of them. I’m a gay Catholic. I’m not going anywhere.<br>

            You simply can't receive Communion until the situation is

          <p>
            That's hard, but it's not rejection. Many people in this situation

            and service. <br><br>Talk to a priest about your specific situation.

          <p>
            Coming back to the Church may not be possible or healthy for you. 
            If you choose to try, please do it with support: a therapist, a 
            safe spiritual director, a survivor group. You don't owe the 
            Church your presence. But if you want to find Christ there despite 
            what happened, that is also your right too and let no one tell you otherwise.

            looking. That's not the fullness of Catholicism. That's tribalism
